    <h2>The history of FC Barcelona | Barcelona Expat LifeFC Barcelona (FCB), also known as Bar√ßa, has a rich heritage rooted in
    its foundation in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club's
    history is marked by its growth from amateur football to a globally recognized institution, with a strong connection to
    Barcelona and Catalonia. FCB's legacy is further solidified by its numerous trophies, including 14 UEFA titles and a
    sextuple, and its influence on the sport through legendary players and coaches like Johan Cruyff and Lionel Messi.</h2>

    <h1><u>El Cl√°sico</u></h1>
    <h2>FC Barcelona were founded in 1899 and Real Madrid three years later, in 1902. It was the latter year in which the first
    El Cl√°sico was played. It was part of the 'Concurso Madrid de Foot-Ball Association,' better known as the Copa de la
    Coronaci√≥n, an unofficial competition. The majority of the initial games between the two teams were friendlies, given
    that LaLiga had yet to be formed and the only national competition was the Copa de Espa√±a.
    
    A rivalry from the beginning
    With the passage of time, the fixture became more regular -especially after LaLiga was founded in 1929.
    
    Disputes over signings -such as the battle for Alfredo di Stefano's signature in the 1950s- and controversial refereeing
    decisions only served to heat up the rivalry. The two clubs also boasted the best players of the era, such as Ladislao
    Kubala and Luis Su√°rez for Bar√ßa and Ferenc Puskas and Di Stefano for Real Madrid.
    
    In the middle of the 20th Century, the rivalry took on a new dimension. It was still known as a derby, rather than 'El
    Cl√°sico' despite both teams being from different cities.</h2>
